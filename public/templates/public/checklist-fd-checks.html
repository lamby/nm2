<h2>Things to check in the mailbox</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The mailbox should be complete with the mails from all involved
  sides.</li>
  <li>All signatures should validate.</li>
  <li>SC + DMUP agreement is present.</li>
  <li>Agreement SC + DMUP is signed with the key that is to go in the DD
  keyring: {{person.fpr|fingerprint}}.</li>
  <li>No mails appear to be missing (missing bits of a thread, missing T&amp;S
  without a reason...)</li>
  <li>Ensure that the login name requested in the mail conversation matches the
  one in the AM report.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the forward email address requested in the mail conversation
  matches the one in the AM report.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Things to check in the OpenPGP key</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Run keycheck.sh again on the applicant key that will go in the keyring,
  as sometimes the AM might run keycheck on the 1024 key and forget to run in
  on the 4096 key.</li>
  <li>Make sure key is 4096 bits, if not check if there is a good reason. Same
  for number of signatures, if there is only one, no other trust paths, and no
  good reason.</li>
  <li>Check if applicant is in the DM keyring: if they are, keyring-maint prefers
  to move the existing key from DM to DD, so the DD key should match the DM key
  and the agreement should be signed with that key.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Things to do after the FD check</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Run /srv/nm.debian.org/bin/nm_stats and update IRCÂ #debian-newmaint
  topic. (FIXME: I'm not sure nm_stats works atm)</li>
</ul>
