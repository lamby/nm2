<h1>Associate SSO username to existing person</h1>

<p>For many Debian Maintainer entries, the site does not currently know the
corresponding username that is used by the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianSingleSignOn">Debian Single Sign-On</a>,
and therefore cannot give you permission on your own data. This page helps to
fix this situation.</p>


<p>Since you are logged in, I already know that your Single Sign-On username is
<b>{{username}}</b>. The missing bit of information is who are you in the site,
and I would like to find out using your GPG key. Please enter the fingerprint
in this form:</p>

<form action="" method="POST">{% csrf_token %}
{{form.as_p}}
<button type="submit">Update</button>
</form>

{% if person %}

<p>
Ok, so you claim to be <a href="{{person.get_absolute_url}}">{{person}}</a>, is
that right? If that is not correct, please change the fingerprint in the form
above and click "Update".
</p>

<p>
If it is correct, I need a way to trust you. Please decrypt the GPG snippet
that you find after this paragraph, and you will find a URL. Visit that URL and
I will be able to trust that you are indeed <a href="{{person.get_absolute_url}}">{{person}}</a>.
