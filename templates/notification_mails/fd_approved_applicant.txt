Subject: Ready for DAM review

Hello {{process.person.fullname|safe}},

I checked your '{{process.applying_for|desc_status|safe}}' application
for issues like missing emails or weak GPG keys and all seems fine.

I have passed your application on to Debian Account Managers, who will reread
everything we have collected so far and make the final approval.

This may take up to a month, depending on how busy are the DAMs. You will
receive an email after this is done.


Regards,

{{log.changed_by.fullname|safe}} (as Front Desk)
