Subject: Waiting for an Application Manager

Hello {{process.person.fullname|safe}},

All your advocacies are ok and you are now waiting to get a new Application
Manager assigned. This does not usually take more than a few days, unless there
are no AMs available.

You will receive an email as soon as a member of Front Desk performs the
assignment, and you will be contacted by the AM shortly afterwards.

For any problems, feel free to contact Front Desk at nm@debian.org.


Regards,

{{log.changed_by.fullname|safe}} (as Front Desk)
