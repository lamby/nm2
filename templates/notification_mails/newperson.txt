Hello {{person.fullname|safe}},

to confirm your new entry at https://nm.debian.org{{person.get_absolute_url}}
you need to send the string {{nonce}}, signed with your key {{person.fpr}}, to
the address {{reply_to}}.

A way to do so is to use this command:

  echo {{nonce}} | gpg --clearsign --default-key {{person.fpr}} | mail {{reply_to}}

Or just reply to this email, making sure that {{nonce}} appears in the text,
and that you sign your reply with the right key.

For any problems, feel free to contact Front Desk at nm@debian.org.

the nm.debian.org robotic minion for Front Desk
