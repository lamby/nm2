 1. <ypcs> make it work locally
    Should be done, see <https://github.com/ypcs/nm2>.
 2. <safanaj> when advocating a DM as DD, default upload rights to true
 3. <olasd> in the weekly report, show names of the people who became DD/DM/got guest
    accounts/* [kibi]
 4. <rybak> implement a one-click "send activity-poll" function
     - mail sent and Cc-ed to the proper archive address
     - set status to "activity poll sent"
    http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/nm/trunk/doc/front-desk/templates/
 5. Allow the short bio to be entered as part of personal information,
    and later even allow any DD to edit/update their own bio.
    This saves a few steps, and could automatically send the presentation
    email to d-newmaint at AM approval time.
    (notify Serafeim Zanikolas)
 6. Add support for south database migrations
 7. <santiago> Change the From: address to <login>@debian.org when sending advocacy emails
