 1. <ypcs> make it work locally
    Should be done, see <https://github.com/ypcs/nm2>.
 2. <safanaj> when advocating a DM as DD, default upload rights to true
 3. <olasd> in the weekly report, show names of the people who became DD/DM/got guest
    accounts/* (notify kibi@debian.org)
 4. <rybak> implement a one-click "send activity-poll" function
     - mail sent and Cc-ed to the proper archive address
     - set status to "activity poll sent"
    http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/nm/trunk/doc/front-desk/templates/
 5. Allow the short bio to be entered as part of personal information,
    and later even allow any DD to edit/update their own bio.
    This saves a few steps, and could automatically send the presentation
    email to d-newmaint at AM approval time.
    (notify sez@d.o)
 6. Add support for south database migrations
 7. <santiago> Change the From: address to <login>@debian.org when sending advocacy emails
    jwilk> (How) can I change e-mail address from which nm.d.o sends my advocacy mails?
    enrico> jwilk: is the @d.o not correct?
    jwilk> @d.o works for me, but it wasn't here:
           https://lists.debian.org/debian-newmaint/2012/06/msg00030.html
    enrico> jwilk: ouch, that is a mistake

 - show the contents of mailbox archives in the web interface
   read only, very simple minded will do

 - In https://nm.debian.org/am/ammain
   make a visual distinction between shortcuts and buttons that have an
   immediate action

 - Add an email notification to the applicant when they get in the queue to get
   an AM assigned (status app_ok)
 - Add an email notification to the applicant when they get approved by the AM,
   saying what is now going to happen: FD will do consistency checks, and then
   pass it on to DAM to decide
 - Add an email notification to the applicant when they get approved by FD,
   saying that now it's up to DAM to have a look and do the final approval.

 - In https://nm.debian.org/am/ammain some shortcuts generate email templates.
   Those buttons are very overloaded now; the interface could get simpler if we
   add a dedicated set of functions to generate the templates. Those templates
   could also be generated anytime.
    - Case in question: DAM clicks OK before copypasting the template

 - Allow advocates to edit personal information of people in active processes
   advocated by them

 - When impersonating other people, log entries should be prefixed by a tag
   like [enrico as ganneff], so that work is credited to the right person

 - Unit tests!
   I (enrico) still have not become proficient with unit testing complex
   websites.

 - stats: graph with number of processes in state 'adv_rcvd', 'app_ok', 'am',
   'am_hold', 'am_ok', 'fd_ok' over time
