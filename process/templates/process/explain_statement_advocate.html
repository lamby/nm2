<p>Advocating a Debian Contributor to have a guest account requires they have
a track record of contributing to Debian. You should read the
<a href="https://dsa.debian.org/doc/guest-account/">DSA guidelines</a> on guest
account access.</p>
{% elif process.applying_for == "dm" %}
<p>See <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer#Advocating_a_Debian_Maintainer">here</a>
for details about advocating someone to be a Debian Maintainer. You should be familiar with their
existing work within Debian and believe it to be of a sufficient standard that they can be
trusted with upload rights to the packages they maintain.</p>
{% elif process.applying_for == "dm_ga" %}
<p>Debian Maintainers do not require advocacy for guest accounts, but should
read the <a href="https://dsa.debian.org/doc/guest-account/">DSA guidelines</a>

proper text editor and paste it in the form when you are happy with it.</p>

<p><b>Warning:</b> upload rights have been requested, and {{person.fullname}}
   does not seem to be a DM. The general rule is that
   <a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/join/">before applying as DD, you should have been a DM for about six months</a>.
   You can still advocate {{person.fullname}}, just please take a moment to elaborate on this.</p>

For nm.debian.org, at {{now|date:"Y-m-d"}}:
I support {{person}}'s request to become {{process.applying_for|desc_status}}.
I have worked with {{person.fullname}} on X and Y for X time and I would like to be able to Z.

I have personally worked with {{person}} (key {{person.fpr}}) for X time,
