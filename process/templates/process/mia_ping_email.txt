Dear {{person.fullname}},

this mail is a "Where art thou" (WAT) ping by Front Desk / Missing In
Action team.

{{text}}

The process is tracked at [1].

If you consider yourself still active in Debian, please visit [2] to let
us know about that. A few words about where you are active will help us to
exclude you from future WAT pings in case our heuristics are too strict.

If you want to retire instead, you can visit [3] to do it with just one
click using nm.debian.org. Retiring has the advantage of the "emeritus"
status that allows you to return to Debian more easily [4]. Also, your
@debian.org mail address will continue to work for 6 months to allow you
to migrate to a different address.

If you fail to respond, we will shut down your Debian account after
{{deadline|date:"F d, Y"}}, and have your OpenPGP key removed from the
Debian keyring, without the benefits of the emeritus status.

We are happy to hear back from you. In any case, thanks for your work in
Debian.


For Front Desk / MIA team,
