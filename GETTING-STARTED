 * Periodic updates

You need to run periodic maintenance to check/regenerate the denormalised
fields:

   ./manage.py maintenance


 * Development

Development targets Django 1.2, as it is the version available on Debian
servers. Luckily django provides excellent backwards compatibility, so the only
thing you have to pay attention to is the version of the Django documentation
that you are reading. Check the version boxes in the bottom right of Diango
documentation pages.
