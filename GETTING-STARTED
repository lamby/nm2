 * Running this code on your own machine

# Dependencies
apt-get install python-django python-ldap python-psycopg2 python-xapian python-debian

# Configuration
ln -s settings.py.devel settings.py
edit settings.py as needed
NB: by default, database is created to `data` subdirectory, you need to create this!

# First setup
./manage.py syncdb

# Fill in data
Visit https://nm.debian.org/am/db-export to download nm-mock.json; for privacy,
sensitive information are replaced with mock strings.

If you cannot login to the site, you can ask any DD to download it for you.
There is nothing secret in the file, but I am afraid of giving out convenient
email databases to anyone.

./manage.py import nm-mock.json

If you are a Front Desk member or a DAM, you can use
https://nm.debian.org/am/db-export?full for a full database export.

# Sync keyrings (if needed)
rsync -az --progress keyring.debian.org::keyrings/keyrings/ ./data/keyrings/

# Run database maintenance
./manage.py maintenance

# Run the web server
./manage.py runserver


 * Periodic updates

You need to run periodic maintenance to check/regenerate the denormalised
fields:

   ./manage.py maintenance


 * Development

Development targets Django 1.2, as it is the version available on Debian
servers. Luckily django provides excellent backwards compatibility, so the only
thing you have to pay attention to is the version of the Django documentation
that you are reading. Check the version boxes in the bottom right of Diango
documentation pages.
